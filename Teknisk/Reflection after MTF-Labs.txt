Reflection after MTF-Labs

The MTF Labs were held as a part of the Music Tech Fest in Stockholm 2018 (3.-9-September). I was invited to parttake in the MTF performance Labs AI together with about 80 other artists and researchers. Michela Magas, voted as EU innovator of the year was the organizer of the lab.

The goal of the lab was to create a performance taking place during the main MTF event September 7.-9. inside a shut down nuclear reactor 25 meters below ground.
